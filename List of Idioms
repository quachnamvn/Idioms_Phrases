turn the clock back
turn the knife
turn the other cheek
turn the tables
turn to your advantage
turn up
turn up like a bad penny
turn up the heat
turn your life around
turn your mind to it
turn your nose up at
turn your stomach
turn back the hands of time
turn in
turning point
twiddle your thumbs
twist someone around your little finger
twist someone's arm
twist the knife
twist your rubber arm
two-time
ugly as sin
under a cloud
under fire
under someone's thumb
under the aegis of
under the auspices of
under the circumstances
under the gun
under the hammer
under the table
under the weather
under the wire
under way
under your breath
underdog
until hell freezes over
until the cows come home
until you are blue in the face
up and running
up for grabs
up front
up in arms
up in the air
up the ante
up to
up to no good
up to par
up to scratch
up to snuff
up to somebody
up to something
up to speed
up to the mark
up to your ears
up to your eyeballs
up to your eyes
up to your neck
up-and-coming
upon the heels of
upper crust
upper hand
ups and downs
upset the applecart
vent your spleen
vicious circle
vicious cycle
wait for the other shoe to drop
wait for your ship to come in
wait on hand and foot
wait out
wake up
wake up on the wrong side of the bed
wake-up call
walk a mile in someone's shoes
walk all over
walk into
walk it off
walk off
walk off the job
walk on air
walk on eggshells
walk out on someone
walk right into
wallflower

warm the bench
warts and all
wash off
wash your dirty laundry in public
wash your dirty linen in public
wash your hands of
washed up
waste your breath
watch over
watch your butt
watch your step
water off a duck's back
water over the dam
water under the bridge
wave of the future
wax and wane
ways and means of
wear a stormy brow
wear and tear
wear many hats
wear on someone
wear out your welcome
wear several hats
wear the pants
wear the trousers
wear your heart on your sleeve
weasel out
weather the storm
week after week
week in week out
weirdo
welcome to the club
well begun is half done
wet behind the ears
wet blanket
what about
What are you waiting for? Christmas?
what do you say
What gives?
what say
what's done is done
What's up?
What's your point?
wheel and deal
when hell freezes over
when in Rome, do as the Romans do
when push comes to shove
when the chips are down
when the dust settles
whet your appetite
whip into shape
whistle in the dark
white elephant
whitewash
whole hog
whoop it up
wide awake
wide of the mark
wild about
wild-goose chase
will have to do
will never fly
wimp
wimp out
win by a hair
win by a nose
win by a whisker
win hands down
wind someone around your little finger
wind up
windbag
window of opportunity
wing it
wipe the slate clean
wish for the moon
with a bang
with bated breath
with flying colors
with me
with something to spare
within an inch of
without a clue
without a hitch
without any strings attached
without batting an eye
without batting an eyelash
without batting an eyelid
without fail
without question
withstand the test of time
wolf in sheep's clothing
woman of means
word by word
word for word
work like a charm
work out
work someone into the ground
work the bugs out
work the system
work through channels
work wonders
work your butt off
work your fingers to the bone
work your socks off
work your tail off
work your way up
work yourself up to
worm your way in
worth your salt
worth your weight in gold
worth your weight in salt
worth your while
wouldn't say boo to a goose
wrap someone around your little finger
wrap up loose ends
x-rated
year after year
year in year out
year in, year out
yell bloody murder
yellow-bellied
yes-man
you bet
You can say that again!
you have got to be kidding
you know
you must be kidding
You said it!
your eyes are bigger than your belly
your eyes are bigger than your stomach
your eyes pop out of your head
your own flesh and blood
You're telling me!
zip your lip
