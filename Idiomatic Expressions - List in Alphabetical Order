a bad penny
The phrase a bad penny refers to a person or thing which is unpleasant, dishonorable, or unwanted that is likely to reappear, particularly at inconvenient times.

The phrase a bad penny is usually used in the proverb:

A bad penny always turns up.

The origin of the phrase


The phrase 'a bad penny always turns up' is a very old saying. It is worthwhile noting that pennies were ripe targets for counterfeiters. When people discovered that those counterfeited pennies had reached their pockets, the only solution available was to try to spend them as quickly as possible. But because everyone was trying to get rid of those 'bad pennies', the chance of encountering the very same one you had spent earlier was quite high. Accordingly, the phrase 'bad penny' became an expression referring to an unpopular or undesired thing or person that keeps reappearing.
We thought we wouldn't see John again after what he did, but he showed up at the party - a bad penny always turns up.

I have often wished to say this to you,' Tom continued with an embarrassment that became him very well, 'but you have never given me an opportunity.'

The phrase fifth column refers to a group within a country at war who are sympathetic to or collaborate with its enemies.

The origin of the idiom

As far as the origin of the idiom 'fifth column', Wikipedia states that the phrase was used by rebel general Emilio Mola during the Spanish Civil War. He boasted that while his four columns of troops approached Madrid, a "fifth column" of supporters inside the city were working with him to defeat the Republican government under Francisco Caballero:
During the Siege of Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, Nationalist general Emilio Mola told a journalist in 1936 that as his four columns of troops approached Madrid, a "fifth column" (Spanish: Quinta columna) of supporters inside the city would support him and undermine the Republican government from within.

The term was then widely used in Spain, and Ernest Hemingway used it as the title of his only play, which he wrote in Madrid while the city was being bombarded and published in 1938 in his book The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories.

"There are some people bent on blowing up the situation in the country. I call them the fifth column. They are not an opposition. They want to stage a rebellion in the country. Their dream is to topple the government and overthrow the president." Alexander Lukashenko

foot in the door
To get a foot in the door means to make initial contact or to get an opportunity.

The origin of the idiom

The origin of the idiom comes from a tactic used by door-to-door salesmen. These salesmen usually block the door from being closed using their foot so that they can get the chance to convince the house owner to buy his product.

This tactic has evolved to become a business technique called: 'foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique'. It is a compliance tactic that aims at getting a person to agree to a large request by having them agree to a modest request first.
He made the first contact with the boss. This helped him get a foot in the door.

frog in one's throat
To have a frog in one's throat means to be unable to speak clearly because one's throat is dry or blocked.

The idiom may refer to real hoarseness or the inability to speak because of fear.

The origin of the phrase

The legend has it that quacks (that is unqualified traveling doctors) used to sell fake cures for throat problems. They deceived people by having an assistant who pretended to have a ‘frog in his throat’. The fake doctor would give medicine to the assistant causing him to cough up a live frog and all of a sudden recover his voice!
frog
I can hardly talk! I have a frog in my throat because of the cold weather.

A: Have you noticed that Jane had a frog in her throat? She was so terrified that she couldn't utter a word.
B: Yes, she couldn't believe that she was caught red-handed and that she would spend the rest of her life in jail.

The phrase has become popular thanks to the American philosopher, Walter B. Pitkin, who published a self-help book in 1932 entitled "Life Begins at Forty".

Quote


Here is a famous quote by Helen Rowland using the phrase:

Life begins at 40 - but so do fallen arches, rheumatism, faulty eyesight, and the tendency to tell a story to the same person, three or four times.

Alan: "Why are you so depressed?"
Jane: "Tomorrow's my fortieth birthday."

I don't believe what he says. It is made out of whole cloth to me.

nothing is certain but death and taxes
The phrase nothing is certain but death and taxes means that everything in life is uncertain. The only things that you can be sure of are:
1. You will undoubtedly die.
2. You will certainly have to pay taxes.

This saying comes from the letters of Benjamin Franklin where he states:
Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.
�Benjamin Franklin, in a letter to Jean-Baptiste Leroy, 1789


However, Franklin's letter is not the origin of the phrase; it appeared earlier in Daniel Defoe's The History of the Devil:
Things as certain as Death and Taxes, can be more firmly believ�d.
�Daniel Defoe The Political History of the Devil 1726.


But it should be noted that the origin of the phrase dates back to Daniel Defoe's The History of the Devil:

Things as certain as Death and Taxes, can be more firmly believed.

Spuntnick moment
The phrase Sputnik moment refers to a moment of challenge when a society or person realizes they must work harder to surpass their competitors.

The phrase was popularized by Barack Obama in his State of the Union address in 2011.

The origin of the idiom comes from the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first Earth-orbiting satellite Sputnik 1, which was a great achievement at that moment, while the US were lagging behind in space technology. This caused the space race to start between the two countries. The US ultimately won the race in 1969 with the first human landing on the Moon.
This generation's "Sputnik moment" has arrived, President Barack Obama declared in his State of the Union address, referring to the United States' need to invest in research and development to revive the economy and ensure future stability.

If you take something or someone at face value, you accept that they are as they seem without looking for a hidden meaning or ulterior motives.

Origin of the idiom 'take something or someone at face value'

The idiom 'take something or someone at face value' may originate from the phrase 'face value', which refers to the value printed or depicted on a coin, banknote, postage stamp, ticket, etc. The value of a coin or bill is clearly visible from the numbers printed on it. So, like a coin, taking something or someone at face value means taking them as they seem to be, without verifying, investigating, or looking for hidden meanings or secret motives.
The prime minister's speech should not necessarily be taken at face value.

Please, don't take what he says at face value! He clearly has an ulterior motive.

tall order
The phrase a tall order refers to something that is very difficult to do.

Origin

The adjective 'tall' probably comes from Middle English 'tal'. Its meaning has developed throughout centuries. Its primary sense is "high in stature", but other meanings have been attributed to it:

"handsome, good-looking; valiant; lively in speech; large, big; humble, meek."

Used in this idiom, the adjective refers to things large in amount or size. Thus, a tall order refers to a task or a job that is hard to accomplish.

Another instance of an idiom that uses the adjective 'tall' to mean considerable or exaggerated is the following:

tall tale.

A tall tale refers to a long and complicated story that is difficult to believe because some of its events are improbable or impossible.
To win the match against such a good team is a tall order for them.

the spirit of the law
When one obeys the spirit of the law but not the letter, one is doing what the authors of the law intended, though not necessarily adhering to the literal wording. (See also letter of the law)

In one of the best known examples, The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare introduces the quibble as a plot device to save both the spirit and the letter of the law. The moneylender Shylock has made an agreement with Antonio that if he cannot repay a loan he will have a pound of flesh from him. When the debt is not repaid in time Portia at first pleads for mercy in a famous speech:

"The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes." (IV,i,185).


When Shylock refuses, she finally saves Antonio by pointing out that Shylock's agreement with him mentioned no blood, and therefore Shylock can have his pound of flesh only if he sheds no blood.

To turn in one's grave or to turn over in one's grave is an idiomatic expression used to describe the anger, disgust, or horror of a dead person if he or she were alive to hear of a certain news story, action or idea—especially a negative one.

"Thus have we done a thing altogether unknown in the history of this country; a thing which would have scared all former politicians; a thing, which, if our old Whig politicians were now to hear, they would turn in their graves."
